# cute
*Cute or Really Cute* is a web app for cat lovers that is modeled off of the 90s site *Hot or Not.*

Users can visit the site and rate the cuteness of the cats others have submitted. Or they can upload their own cute cat photos and stories to be rated by others. Once a cat has been uploaded, users can search for their cat by its name or ID number, and then can see the average ratings their cat has received.
